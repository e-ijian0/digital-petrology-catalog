# Navajo Sandstone (SS002)

## Physical Description
*   **Color:** Pale orange to white, with occasional reddish iron‑oxide bands
*   **Texture:** Clastic, well‑sorted, medium‑grained
*   **Grain Size:** 0.2–0.5 mm (fine to medium sand)
*   **Hardness (Mohs):** 6–7 (quartz grains dominate)
*   **Other Notable Features:** Exhibits large‑scale cross‑bedding (visible in cliff faces); grains are rounded to sub‑rounded; silica cement gives a durable, compact fabric.

## Geological Context
*   **Formation Name (if known):** Navajo Sandstone (part of the Glen Canyon Group)
*   **Geologic Era/Period:** Early Jurassic (≈190–180 million years ago)
*   **Environment of Deposition/Formation:** Eolian (wind‑blown) dune field in a vast desert (erg) that covered much of the Colorado Plateau; deposited by prevailing westerly winds in a hyper‑arid climate.

## Environmental Significance
*   The Navajo Sandstone is one of the most extensive aeolian sandstone units in the geologic record, preserving a snapshot of a giant Jurassic desert that stretched across western North America. Its well‑sorted, rounded quartz grains and large‑scale cross‑beds are classic indicators of prolonged wind transport and dune migration. The occasional iron‑oxide bands record episodes of groundwater movement and oxidation long after deposition. Today’s dramatic cliffs and slot canyons of Zion National Park are carved into this sandstone, illustrating how a once‑vast desert can be uplifted, cemented, and sculpted by fluvial erosion into iconic landscapes. The rock thus serves as a key archive of Jurassic paleoclimate, showing that the region experienced extreme aridity similar to modern Saharan‑scale deserts, followed by tectonic uplift and erosional dissection during the Cenozoic.
