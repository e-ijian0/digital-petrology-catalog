# Half Dome Granite (GR001)

## Physical Description
*   **Color:** Light gray to white, with scattered black biotite and hornblende crystals
*   **Texture:** Phaneritic (coarse‑grained), equigranular
*   **Grain Size:** 2–5 mm average, with some phenocrysts up to 10 mm
*   **Hardness (Mohs):** 6–7 (feldspar and quartz dominate)
*   **Other Notable Features:** Contains distinctive pink potassium feldspar phenocrysts; shows exfoliation weathering typical of Yosemite domes; fresh surfaces exhibit a salt‑and‑pepper appearance.

## Geological Context
*   **Formation Name (if known):** Half Dome Granodiorite (part of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite)
*   **Geologic Era/Period:** Cretaceous (≈93–85 million years ago)
*   **Environment of Deposition/Formation:** Plutonic intrusion at depth (~5–10 km) within the Sierra Nevada batholith; formed from slow cooling of magma in a subduction‑related continental arc.

## Environmental Significance
*   This granitic rock records the protracted magmatic history of the Sierra Nevada arc during the late Cretaceous. Its coarse‑grained texture indicates slow cooling at depth, suggesting a stable, long‑lived magma chamber. The presence of both biotite and hornblende points to a hydrous magma source, consistent with fluids released from the subducting Farallon plate. Today’s dramatic exfoliation domes (Half Dome, El Capitan) are a direct result of uplift, erosion, and stress‑release fracturing of this granite, illustrating how deep‑seated intrusions can shape iconic mountain landscapes millions of years after their formation. The sample thus serves as a tangible record of Mesozoic subduction, continental‑arc magmatism, and subsequent Cenozoic uplift and glaciation that carved Yosemite Valley.
